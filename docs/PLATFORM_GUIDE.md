## System Overview

LSU AI Spark is an interactive learning platform designed to teach artificial intelligence concepts through structured modules and hands-on learning. The platform offers a progression-based curriculum that takes learners from beginner to advanced levels in AI education.

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript, Vite as the build tool
- **UI Framework**: Tailwind CSS with Shadcn UI components
- **State Management**: React Context API
- **Data Persistence**: LocalStorage (client-side storage)
- **Routing**: React Router for navigation
- **Animations**: CSS transitions and Tailwind animations

## User Journey

### 1. User Authentication
- New users register with name, email, and password
- Returning users log in with email and password
- Authentication state is managed through React Context
- User credentials and progress are stored in localStorage
- Protected routes ensure only authenticated users can access certain pages

### 2. Learning Path
- Users begin with the Beginner level (initially only first module unlocked)
- Complete modules to unlock subsequent content
- Take quizzes to demonstrate knowledge
- Earn level completion certificates
- Progress through Intermediate and Advanced levels

### 3. Learning Experience
- Each module contains 4 topic lessons
- Interactive content with videos and supporting materials
- End-of-module quizzes to test comprehension
- Progress tracking shows completion percentage
- Visual indicators for locked and unlocked content

## Core Functionality

### Authentication System
The platform uses a client-side authentication system with the following features:
- User registration and login
- Session persistence through localStorage
- Protected routes that redirect unauthenticated users
- User context provider that makes authentication state available throughout the app

```typescript
// Authentication flow
1. User submits login/signup form
2. UserContext processes credentials (mock authentication)
3. User state is stored in localStorage
4. Protected routes check authentication status before rendering
```

### Module Progression System
The platform implements a structured progression system:
- Modules are grouped into three levels: Beginner, Intermediate, and Advanced
- Each level contains multiple learning modules
- Modules unlock sequentially as users complete prerequisites
- Level completion unlocks the first module of the next level

```typescript
// Module unlocking logic
1. User completes a module (watches all topics and passes quiz)
2. System determines next module in the sequence
3. Next module is added to the user's unlockedModules array
4. UI updates to show newly available content
```

### Quiz and Assessment
Each module includes a quiz to test knowledge:
- Quizzes are presented at the end of each module
- Scores are recorded and displayed on the dashboard
- Quiz completion contributes to overall progress
- Passing a quiz is required to complete a module

### Certification System
The platform awards certificates upon level completion:
- Users receive certificates after completing all modules in a level
- Certificates are accessible from the dashboard
- Level completion unlocks the next level of learning

## Data Management

### Data Storage
All user data is currently stored locally using the browser's localStorage API:
- User authentication information
- Module progress tracking
- Quiz scores
- Unlocked modules
- Completed levels for certification

```javascript
// LocalStorage data structure
{
  user: { id, name, email },
  userProgress: { [moduleId]: { [topicId]: boolean } },
  quizScores: { [moduleId]: number },
  unlockedModules: [moduleId1, moduleId2, ...],
  completedLevels: [level1, level2, ...]
}
```

### State Management
The application uses React Context API to manage state:
- UserContext provides authentication and user progress data
- State is persisted in localStorage to maintain data between sessions
- Context providers are strategically placed to optimize performance

## Frontend Architecture

### Component Structure
The application follows a modular component-based architecture:
- Layout components establish the overall structure
- Page components represent different routes
- Feature components implement specific functionality
- UI components provide visual elements and interactions

### Routing System
The routing structure is implemented using React Router:
- Public routes (Home, About, Login, etc.)
- Protected routes (Dashboard, Learning modules, etc.)
- Dynamic routes for specific modules and topics

### UI/UX Design
The interface is designed with the following principles:
- Responsive design that works across devices
- Consistent color scheme and visual language
- Clear visual feedback for user actions
- Intuitive navigation and progressive disclosure

## Learning Path Structure

### Level Organization
The platform organizes content into three progressive levels:
- **Beginner Level**: Fundamental AI concepts and introductory material
- **Intermediate Level**: More advanced topics building on the fundamentals
- **Advanced Level**: Specialized knowledge and cutting-edge concepts

### Module Structure
Each level contains multiple modules, and each module follows a consistent structure:
- 4 topics per module
- End-of-module quiz
- Progress tracking
- Prerequisites and dependencies

### Content Progression
Content unlocks according to these rules:
1. Initially, only the first Beginner module is available
2. Completing a module unlocks the next module in the same level
3. Completing all modules in a level:
   - Awards a level certificate
   - Unlocks the first module of the next level

## Future Enhancements

### Database Integration
Future versions could replace localStorage with a proper backend database:
- User data would be stored securely on a server
- Authentication would use industry-standard practices
- Progress would sync across devices

### Content Management System
Adding a CMS would allow:
- Easier content updates without code changes
- Dynamic module and topic creation
- Custom learning paths

### Advanced Analytics
Enhanced analytics could provide:
- Detailed learning metrics for users
- Heatmaps of user engagement
- Personalized learning recommendations

### Social Features
Potential social enhancements:
- Learning communities and discussions
- Peer reviews and collaboration
- Achievement sharing

**Note**: This document describes the current implementation as of April 2025. The platform primarily uses client-side technologies with localStorage for data persistence. A future version may implement server-side functionality for enhanced security, scalability, and feature expansion.
